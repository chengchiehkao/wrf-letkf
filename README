#1 What is WRF-LETKF?
=============================

WRF-LETKF is a data assimilation system implemented LETKF(Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter) and weakly coupled with WRF(Weather Research and Forecasting Model). This DA system is fully designed, implemented and maintained by Cheng-Chieh Kao (chengchiehkao@gmail.com).


=============================
#2 Where can I get WRF-LETKF?
=============================

The source code of WRF-LETKF is now available through certain git host. If you have already installed any git client with command-line interface, just type:

          git clone git@github.com:chengchiehkao/wrf-letkf

then the package will be downloaded.


=============================
#3 How to compile WRF-LETKF?
=============================

#3-1 Prerequisites

#a Fortran Compiler
A Fortran95-standard-compliant(95 or newer) and OpenMP2.5-compliant(V2.5 or newer) Fortran compiler is necessary. The following compilers were tested so far:
     Intel Fortran v19.1.3.304
     Intel Fortran v19.0.5.281
     Intel Fortran v15.0.1
     GNU Fortran v4.4.7
     PGI Fortran v12.10

#b make
make utility is necessary for building WRF-LETKF.

#c NetCDF Library
NetCDF is a library for scientific data I/O and is necessary for compiling WRF-LETKF. At least NetCDF Fortran API should be installed.

#d LAPACK and BLAS Library
LAPACK and BLAS are libraries for linear algebra, which are necessary for WRF-LETKF. Please make sure that the libraries you use are THREAD-SAFE, or the DA system might run into race condition when executing (which means the output will be messed up or the sytem will crash).

#3-2 Compile
Pick a makefile you would like to use and edit the options as the building environment is, then type:

     make -f makefile.[theCompilerYouChoosed]

then a executable named wrfletkf.exe should be generated within few minutes if everything goes fine (actual duration depends on software and hardware condition).
